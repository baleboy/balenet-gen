This site was generated using [balenet-gen](https://github.com/baleboy/balenet-gen), my own static site generator written in Swift with the help of OpenAI Codex. It uses the [Ink](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Ink) markdown parser by John Sundell.

The theme of this site is loosely inspired by the [ZX Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum), my first computer.
